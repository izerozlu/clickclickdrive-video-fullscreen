## Step 1: Download the Extension Files

Download the extension files in an unpacked format. This should typically be a folder containing the extension code, manifest file, and any other necessary assets.

## Step 2: Open Chrome Extensions Page

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Click the three dots (menu) in the top-right corner of the browser to open the menu.
3. Hover over "More Tools" in the menu.
4. Select "Extensions" from the submenu.

## Step 3: Enable Developer Mode

In the "Extensions" page, you will see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top-right corner. Enable this switch by clicking it. This will enable developer mode for Chrome extensions.

## Step 4: Load Unpacked

1. After enabling developer mode, you will see three new options on the left side of the screen: "Load unpacked," "Pack extension," and "Update."
2. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.

## Step 5: Select Extension Folder

A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the extension files (the folder containing the extension code and manifest file). Select the folder and click the "Select Folder" button.

## Step 6: Install the Extension

Chrome will now load the extension from the selected folder. You should see the extension's icon appear in the extensions bar.
