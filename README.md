## Step 1: Download the Extension Files

Download the extension files in an unpacked format. This should typically be a folder containing the extension code, manifest file, and any other necessary assets.

## Step 2: Open Chrome Extensions Page

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Click the three dots (menu) in the top-right corner of the browser to open the menu.
3. Hover over "More Tools" in the menu.
4. Select "Extensions" from the submenu.

## Step 3: Enable Developer Mode

In the "Extensions" page, you will see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top-right corner. Enable this switch by clicking it. This will enable developer mode for Chrome extensions.

## Step 4: Load Unpacked

1. After enabling developer mode, you will see three new options on the left side of the screen: "Load unpacked," "Pack extension," and "Update."
2. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.

## Step 5: Select Extension Folder

A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the extension files (the folder containing the extension code and manifest file). Select the folder and click the "Select Folder" button.

## Step 6: Install the Extension

Chrome will now load the extension from the selected folder. You should see the extension's icon appear in the extensions bar.

# How to use it?

**Click to Open the Video:** To open the video in a bigger view, click on the video player. A larger window will appear, showing the video more prominently. This way, you can focus on the video and enjoy it fully. But keep in mind that clickclickdrive.de's videos need an initial click to enable the video. After that you can open the dialog with each click to the video.

**Answer Questions:** Below the video, you'll see a list of questions. Click on the questions to answer them. The answers in the dialog and the original ones are connected via `click` events. So you can choose the answers inside the dialog to actually select answers.

**Close the Window:** If you want to go back to the regular view or close the video dialog, simply click anywhere outside the video window. You can also press the "Escape" key on your keyboard, and the video dialog will close.

**Automatic Opening:** When a new video starts playing (for example when you continue to the next video question), the video dialog will open automatically. This is convenient, so you don't need to click the video player each time.
